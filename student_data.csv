I like there being specific rules, and if something isn't working in a Carol program, there will be a specific reason that you can fix. Scratch and computer programming also made me think about how hard it must be to make and program whole computers. Sometimes I think about how applications like Safari, Notes, or Word in terms of Scratch. What we're doing is relatively simple! A time when something wasn't working is when I was trying to work out how to get all the beacons in level 4. I added a bit at a time, and tested each time I added a new block. It eventually worked the way I want. Another cool thing that happened with Scratch is that I was stuck in my writing about how the characters were going to solve a problem. Then I had an idea: they could write a computer program on Scratch to do it for them!","If I started over again, I think I would add a scene selection, just because I can. I couldn't do it this time because it would involve taking the whole project apart, which I don't want to do. I also might add more interactions between the characters and the person.","One time I had a problem where the characters were speaking really fast— too fast to read what they were saying.

With Chris' help, I made a variable called ""the backdrop"" which is changed when the real backdrop switches. If ""the backdrop"" was ""mango scene"", for example, the arrow, when clicked, would make the scene and variable change to the next scene.",1,This is the Carol the Robot level 5 remix.,"If I started this project over, I would give more thought to the inventory, which still doesn't work completely.

The Programming skills you demonstrated in this project Exceeds Expectations. Your program passes all the tests. You were thoughtful in your answers to the reflection questions, particularly explaining the problem-solving strategy you used when you got stuck. Your explanations of Python syntax and your keyword definitions were accurate.</p>",4,"
Explain one time you got stuck while working on this project because of a misunderstanding. What was the misunderstanding? How did you solve the problem?
You have now completed a few small programs in Python. Compare your feelings about Python with your feelings about Scratch. 
Why is some code indented in Python? Show an example of where you use indentation in your program and explain the meaning of the indentation.
Keywords are words that have special predefined meaning in a language. Choose four of Python's keywords and explain the purpose of each. You can see all of Python's keywords by running the following in interactive Python (type python in Teminal to enter interactive Python):
• One time I got stuck was when play was returning 4 instead of 5. It turned out that play wasn’t counting the initial guess as a guess (which I found out from asking Chris). So all I had to do was take out the part in play that told the program to include the first guess with the other guesses.

• I like Scratch better. Yeah, I know that Python can do WAY more than Scratch but I find Scratch more simple and elegant. You can’t make syntax errors in Scratch. You don’t have to remember all the different keywords. The terminology is simpler and the color-coding makes it easy to understand. Scratch really makes sense and “clicks” in my mind. I appreciate Python but I feel like I know Scratch “fluently”. For example, I made a guessing game program in Scratch is about five minutes. Of course, this may be because I have more practice with Scratch than with Python.

• In Python, code is indented when one piece of code affects the other. Like in definitions and loops. This sort of happens in Scratch too. For example:

def example():
        if x == y:                        <— This is the beginning of a loop
                print(“xyz”)        <— and this is affected by what the loop says
        else:
                print(“abc”)

•        * print(“x”) — prints whatever is contained between the quotation marks on the screen
        * if ______ — checks conditions in accordance with other conditions and does what you put in if certain conditions are met
        * def x() — define a function
        * not x — boolean function that describes everything but the thing you are negating—for example, not True = False.
(Those definitions are all my own!)",4,"<p>In the Entrepreneurial Website assignment, you were asked to learn more HTML and CSS (and learn how to learn new techniques using online resources), use TextWrangler to edit files, and manage all the different files required to create a rich website.

<p>Your use of Computational Thinking in this project Exceeds Expectations. Your functions use lists effectively. All the functions you defined perform the correct calculation. You added some functions beyond those which were required!</p>
<p>Your use of Programming in this project Meets Expectations. The comments you wrote before the functions did a good job of allowing a reader to understand how to use them. Several of your functions perform the correct calculation, but return the wrong type of value. For example, one function returns a list with the answer inside, instead of just the answer. Your fraction_to_percent function returns the string ""40%"" instead of the float 40.0. This would make it difficult to combine your function together with other functions later, since other functions will not accept the string as an input. You used assertions effectively to test the functions you wrote.</p>

I learned not just about how to program but also about problem solving and how I go through the process of making sense of things that are hard for me to understand. I can use these things I have learned with all the things that I struggle with, not just in computer science. I remember one of the moments when I was stuck, when I was ready to throw my computer into the wall. Where I was supposed to type YES in the box where it asks 'beacon?' I put a space in front of the YES and the command didn't work. I tried multipul ways to fix the problem, taking it apart, trying it over and over, and many other ways but I couldn't figure out what the problem was. After about half an hour of trying to find the problem, I finally called you over and asked for help. I know that this will not always help me solve the problem, that I will need to find the answer on my own, but it is always good to know that as a last resort, you can always ask for help.","If I were to start this project over again, I would spend less time making backdrops and spend more time writing scripts. My problem was not procrastinating, but it was in time management. In my next project, I will make sure to spend less time on the art. ","I remember one time when I got stuck creating this project, when I didn't know how I could get one sprite to pick up the other sprite. I went through my options. I couldn't take apart the code, I didn't have any code to take apart and I didn't want to ask for help, not just yet. I asked myself the question, ""What would I do if I had to pick up something in real life?"" the answer was ""I would bend down and pick it up."" It was that simple. After I got this answer from myself, I designed several different costumes for my sprites and made them move with each other to give the impression of bending over and picking up. I will be sure to use this problem-solving skill again when I get stuck.","One new technique that I learned in the process of creation of this project, is the ""change color effect by: ___"" option. This technique changes the appearance of a sprite or backdrop, which draws a persons eye. If some one is looking at something, they are most likely paying attention to that thing, and that is powerful. You can do many things with a person's attention, but I used it to let the person who is operating my story know when and where to click to make the story move on. I learned this technique from Chris, in his three little pigs example project, and I found this technique very useful.

One place that I got stuck during this project was when I wrote a line that said something like ‘guess_secret_number == False’. By writing == I was telling the computer to rename (to some extent) the code that was ‘guess_secret_number’ ‘False’, instead of telling the computer that the user had not guessed the secret number. I should have written ‘guess_secret_number = False. It turns out, however that even with correction this was not correct code and I deleted it and found a better answer.
2. I feel more comfortable in Scratch then I do in Python. I know that they are virtually the same thing, but I have spent more time working with scratch and it seems more inviting to me. I am still a little bit scared and confused by Python.
3.  Indentation is used in Python to show the program that it is part of the definition that is in the line above. In the example below ‘get_and_process_guess’ is being defined and everything that is written and indented beneath is part of the definition.

def get_and_process_guess(secretNumber):

    player_guess = get_numeric_guess()

    if player_guess == secretNumber:

        print (""Yay! You guessed the secret number, you win!!!"")

        return True

4.    4. The four keywords that I chose from python are:

a.    Def

Def is short for definition. You use the word def if you want to define a new variable or argument.

b.    Print

Print how you get your program to show text to your user. If the user is playing your guessing game and they guess a number that is too high you can put in the code below.

print (""Sorry, that number is too high."")

c.     If

This command tells the program to check something and if that something is ___ (how you want it to be) then do ____. This keyword is helpful so that you can get one individual variable to do something without the whole group of variables doing it as well.

d.    False

This keyword tells that program that something is not true or not equal. An example of how this is used in python is shown below.

 

I_have_a_number = False

1. A time I got stuck was when I was using different names for variables. My friend was showing me how to fix my problem, and I accidentally used what she was titling her variables, to what I was. I fixed it by going through and fixing my mistakes once I realized what they were.
2. I really liked scratches visual drag and drop style because it made things easier to understand. However you can do a lot more in python, so it’s also fun.
3. Code is indented under things like “while” or when you are defining something. I used “while"" to make things keep going in my project. I used “def” when I made a new variable and things like that.
4. “Print” makes things show up like talking to the user. “if” is just what it sounds like: if something happens or if it’s true, something will happen. “def” is when you diffuse something, so when you use the command, what ever you told it to do will happen. “else” is when the “if” doesn’t happen, then whatever you programed it to do, it will.

 -Why is some code indented in Python? Show an example of where you use indentation in your program and explain the meaning of the indentation.

Code is indented on Python to show that the lines of code written below a line of code is a part of it. For example, I was having a problem in my program due to having a misplaced code that should of not been indented:

def play(maximum):
    secret_number = get_secret_number(maximum)
    num_of_guesses = 0
    game_is_over = False
    while game_is_over == False: 
        game_is_over = get_and_process_guess(secret_number)
        num_of_guesses = num_of_guesses + 1
    print (""Congratulations, you only took "") + str(num_of_guesses) + ("" tries to guess the number! "")
    return num_of_guesses

The program was not functioning correctly due to having   
print (""Congratulations, you only took "") + str(num_of_guesses) + ("" tries to guess the number! “) indented, thus making it function throughout the guessing game whenever someone guessed a number, when it was only supposed to show the message after the player guessed the number.

I got help from Elena and she explained how it worked to me. 
Python is a lot harder to understand and write that Scratch. Scratch is very easy because I just have to drag different blocks to places. in Python I have to try to understand the different codes.
The indentations tell you what will happen. On line 35 it says ""else:” Below that it says all these commands. It is indented because it’s supposed to do something. In scratch, there were repeats and  you would put commands into the repeat block so then it would repeat. This is sort of like it because if it wasn’t indented it would be a new command.
“print” is a keyword. Print makes the program say things if you put words into it. “def” is also a keyword. It means define. If you put def in front of something it defines the action. Return, like its name, returns something to the player. “Else” is a keyword. You can use “else” when there are multiple probabilities.

You have now completed a few small programs in Python. Compare your feelings about Python with your feelings about Scratch.
Python and scratch are similar and different at the same time. Python is like scratch except in word form. It also seems like python is more complicated for me since the words aren’t just there for you like in scratch.

Why is some code indented in Python? Show an example of where you use indentation in your program and explain the meaning of the indentation.
Indentation shows which part of code goes in another part of code, so that it makes sense. For example when I did if and else, you have to indent the stuff inside to show that you know it is a part of the if and else.

Keywords are words that have special predefined meaning in a language. Choose four of Python's keywords and explain the purpose of each. You can see all of Python's keywords by running the following in interactive Python (type python in Terminal to enter interactive Python): 

“If” states something that can be added with “Else” which says something other then “if”. “Print” allows you to see text on python. Finally “return” allows you to communicate with the computer to give something back to it.

I solved this problem by getting help from you at OH and from some of my friends. I actually like python more than scratch because once you understand the code or “speak it fluently” it get’s easier to type a program. The meaning of an indention in python is when you start you don’t have on so everything that you type in that from then on is part of it. Every time you make a new indention you make a new thing inside of your old one. By the way it is hard to explain you can ask me in person if you want. One of my key words is count, this is a word were every time you guess it adds one  to count and in the end it tells you how many times you’ve guessed. Another one of my special words is secret_number, this means when the game starts it picks a secret_number and that is the guess you are trying to guess. Game_over means when you have given the game a guess it decides if the game is over or not meaning it tells you if guessed the right guess or not, if you have guessed the right guess the game says “yay you guessed it” but if you didn’t it says “try again”. One of the last important variables is got_a_real_int, this is important so the player can’t type in zebra and the game will tell them guess again instead it will tell them that it’s not a real integer. Over all I thought this was a fun project.

Doing the scratch project was like math class in a way, because it’s like an interesting problem that you have to solve.

If it guessed again it would add more guesses to the count and the secrete number would not change. I figured this out by talking to celena and she said that it was following a string of commands so I tried to un-indent the print (""you took"", guesses, ""guesses”) line and that worked.
I think Python is harder and easer at the same time; with python you can check what’s wrong with the guess.test.py and that helps but there are way more ways that thing can go wrong, it’s also faster because I don’t need to deal with blocks and clicking on the categories like it scratch; but scratch was very simple because all the blocks were already there.
some code is indented in python because that code is is a subcommand of the first command. an example is:
         def play(maximum):
                   print(""Hi! Welcome to Guessing Game”)

For example, instead of 5 guesses, which was correct, it would return 4. What happened was that I forgot to add a guess to count when they guessed the correct number. I only had it counting the guesses they got wrong. So I added count = count + 1 after they guessed correctly too.

        In Scratch, the things you were able to do where limited, but it was clear what each block did and how to use it. In Python, you kind of have to write your own blocks. It is harder, because you don’t always know how to write a function to do what you want, but Python is a lot more powerful than Scratch. Because you write each command you can have it do whatever you want. You aren’t limited to pre-made blocks. 

         When code is indented in Python, that means the indented line is part of the previous. Kind of like how paragraphs are indented but the other way around. 
                if player_guess > secretNumber:
                           print (""That's too high!”)
        This code is saying that if the payer’s guess is more than the secret number, it will say, ""That's too high!” Since, ""print (""That's too high!”)” is indented the program knows that only if the first line is true, can it run the second, indented, line. 

        print is used to write words as strings. If you want to talk to the user in words you use print. 
        else means that if the first command isn’t true, or doesn’t apply, then do this.
        import is a way to get a lot of pre coded commands from the internet. For Guessing Game we import randit from the website random. That means we are taking the code from random and putting it into our program, without having to explain to the program how to do it.

2. Scratch was way easier and there were blocks that were colored that told us how to program. Python felt more like real programing to me because we had write out everything and there were only very basic commands that python knew. Indentation shows that the command that you indent is making the big command work. For example, 

if secret_number < guess:
        print(“You guessed too high!”)
That means that the printing happens when the guess is too high. 

3. 
“print” literally prints the words on the screen when you ask it to. 
“if” works when you want something to happen only if another thing happens
“else” is the opposite of if, so if something doesn’t happen, then the else function pops in
“def” defines a word that you want to use in the rest of your program. Ex: def get_numeric_guess

What was the misunderstanding? How did you solve the problem?
I got stuck once when there was a syntax error on line 54 and just could not figure out what was the problem. It was a simple line and Celina couldn’t figure out what it was either. I looked over the whole section and realized that I was using about secret number instead of secret_number. The problem was fixed after that.

You have now completed a few small programs in Python. Compare your feelings about Python with your feelings about Scratch.
I still like scratch better, probably because it’s less confusing and there’s less to make mistakes on, but python is undeniably more powerful/useful. The “say” is fun.

Why is some code indented in Python? Show an example of where you use indentation in your program and explain the meaning of the indentation.                                                                                                                                            
I use the indent here to show that the computer should ""print(""Too low!”)"" if ""guess_x < secret_number”

Keywords are words that have special predefined meaning in a language. Choose four of Python's keywords and explain the purpose of each. You can see all of Python's keywords by running the following in interactive Python (type python in Teminal to enter interactive Python):
“else"" is a keyword, and I use it when; if something doesn’t happen, then else will represent if that something doesn’t happen the computer should do this. 
""define"" (def) is a keyword that I use when I’m going to define a command.
“print"" is the keyword I use when I want something to appear in my python program in terminal.
""return"" is what I put in TextWrangler when I want the program in python to give the user a number.

3. Code is indented because it shows what is part of another piece of code. An example is using the keyword â€œdef"". I indented underneath to show what the program should do when the block shows up.

I got stuck once because I misunderstood what maximum was doing, and so I tried to define maximum to early. I solved the problem but deleting my whole code and starting over (I had messed up beyond the point of no return).
You have now completed a few small programs in Python. Compare your feelings about Python with your feelings about Scratch.
I prefer python because you can do so much more in the world of python than you can in scratch. I also enjoy using python because I feel that it is more of a challenge whereas with scratch if I took 5 minutes, I could figure most things out, this is more challenging.
Why is some code indented in Python? Show an example of where you use indentation in your program and explain the meaning of the indentation.
Code is indented to keep something inside a function. One example is when in get_and_process_guess(secretNumber), you had to tell the player the number was to low, but there was a certain time to do that. By indenting it, you made sure that it only told the player that at the right time.
Keywords are words that have special predefined meaning in a language. Choose four of Python's keywords and explain the purpose of each. You can see all of Python's keywords by running the following in interactive Python (type python in Teminal to enter interactive Python):
1. Print: Print writes script on the screen.
2. Else: Else will make it so that if the code doesn’t meet if’s requirements, it will do this instead.
3. Def: Def defines something, basically letting you make a new keyword for the program
4. If: If is used to have it so that a command will be followed only if the program meets it’s expectations

The Programming skills you demonstrated in this project Meets Expectations. Your program did not pass all the tests in guess_test. Your reflection questions were complete and thoughtful. Your explanations of Python syntax and your keyword definitions were accurate.</p>",3,"1. I got stuck when my code kept saying 
	> Expected get_and_process_guess(45) to return False when the player guesses 12. 
because I had only wrote in return True, but I needed a return False for when the person guessed wrong. I finally solved it when I put in the return False code. 

2. I think that in some ways Scratch was easier, because it already had things made for you, and you didn’t have to do so much typing. With Python, you can do exactly what Scratch does, but with way more control. And there are many more things in Python that really enable you to do anything! It is really awesome once you get the hang of it. 

3. I think the code is indented in Python because it breaks up the code a little bit. I’m not exactly sure how to explain it, but I feel like it is a mark of how the code works, because Python would get confused if you just had one long continuous string of coding. 
My example where I used indentation was 
def get_and_process_guess(secretNumber):
    guess = get_numeric_guess()
    if guess == secretNumber:
        print(""Yay! You win!"")
        return True  
    else:
        if guess < secretNumber: 
            print(""Sorry! That is too low."")
        if guess > secretNumber:
            print(""Sorry! That is too high"")
        return False
I used indentations after the 
if guess < secretNumber: 
	print(“Sorry! That is too low.”) 

That was important because you need to print the words after you guess each time, and if it just transitions from secretNumber: right to print(“Sorry that is too”)… then the “print” would have no point and you would have to delete that in order for your code to work. 

4. def: Def is short for define, and you use it Python to define a “block” If you were going to make a program that drew a person eating pie, you would have to define pie, or at least that would make it much easier. 

if: If is saying that “if”something does something, do something. So, if I said “if guess == number
		print(""Yay! You finally gave us a number!”)” 
Then that shows if someone finally gives you a number, say what is printed. 

else: Else is kind of like the opposite of “if”. If something said 
if guess == number
	print(“Yay! You finally gave us a number!”) 
else:
	print(“Oh come on! Give us a number already!”) 
then it would mean if the thing the person gave was not a number, it would be categorized under “else”. 

print: Print means to make text in your program. If I wanted my program to say waffles after the person made their first guess, or something like that, I would type
print(“waffles”) 
after whatever code I wanted to put it after.

- One time that I got stuck was when we had to write the code for guess.py, because I had overcomplicated my thinking for the code and tried a bunch of different things. So I had asked 2 friends of mine for help, and I realized how not so complicated that code actually was.

- I feel that python is more complicated, because in python you have to define things in a certain way, and indent certain things, and say things a certain way. In Scratch, I feel like its easier, because there are already blocks laid out for you ready to be filled in. Its also a little easier to define things.

- When you use an indent in python, it means that you’re explaining something if something happens. For example: 
if guess == secretNumber:
        print(""Yaaay! You got the secret number!"")
        return True
This is saying that if the users guess is true, say “Yaaay! You got the secret number!” and tell the player that it is true.

-Here are my 4 python keywords:

-def: Means to define something, give the definition of.
-if: Means if something happens, do this.
-print: Means to say something.
-while: Means to repeat.

I once got stuck on a syntax error because I was confused, I had not edited the line at all but had added things before it, which messed up the indent. I think it was Naomi who first spotted the error and helped me fix it.

2. I constantly find my self looking at a Python function and thinking in what ways it is similar and different to a block in Scratch. When I want to make a function in Python, I often think about the same function in Scratch and how much easier it is. I think that Scratch is definitely easier, and sometimes more fun for that reason, but as a learn more Python it will stop being so hard and I will like it more because it does not have the limitations of Scratch.

3. Define Do_it:
        while number == False:
                print(“No!”)
                return False

The non-indented text is the function being defined, the text with one indent is the (independent variable?), and the double-indented text is the things that will happen if the independent variable is the bool specified.

4. print: Shows the user the things in the print brackets in plain text.
    is: Acts as an equals sign when comparing two things. Same as ==.
    break: If something is on an infinite loop, it breaks the loop.
    elif(aka elifant.): Acts as an “if else” keyword. Could be defined “Also, if…”.

1. On this project, I got stuck on the last step of the project, play. At first, I thought you didn’t have to indent any of the script for play but when it didn’t work, I looked at someone else’s script and I indented the parts that needed to be. After that, my script still didn’t work and then I figured out that my indenting was messed up.
2. I like scratch better because there are blocks for the words and you don’t have to write the right sequence of words. I also like how python gives you a bigger challenge.
3. The indent tell what is going to happen. For example: it says else and after on the line below that (indented) I wrote that it would say “too high”.
4. Print: says what ever words you put after it 
Return: returns a variable
Def: defines something
Else: lets you write another choice

 while (foundSecretNumber == False):
        foundSecretNumber = get_and_process_guess(secretNumber)
        guess_count = guess_count + 1

I used in indent here to show, while found secret number is false do this.

a. Elif means else if, it says if that is not it, do this, for example 
elif guess > secretNumber:
            print ("" Too high."")
            return False 
I said elif because if the guess was not the secret number I needed to have  it do this.

b. Print means say when you run the program whatever was in print will show up. For example,
 print(""Hahaha, very funny but isnt an integer. Go back to kindergarden."")
I put print because it tells the user Hahaha, very funny but isnt an integer. Go back to kindergarden.

c. Else means if it is not this, then do this. For example,
 else:

Also, one day when I was trying to load the page it wouldn't load and I kept trying for several days but it wouldn't work. I solved those problems by starting over again.

I corrected this issue by going to one of my friends that had already finished that section of the project and they helped explain what the spacing was and why it had to be spaced like that.

2)I feel that python is a lot more complicated than scratch because unlike in scratch python does not translate the code that you use into english. Python is also useful though because it tells you what is wrong with the project and scratch does not tell you what is wrong with the script. I think that overall I like scratch better but I with the more projects we have on python I might grow to like it more.

3)Code is indented because it is telling python that it the part that is indented happens right at the same time as the line above. For example in this part of the program                 def get_secret_number(maximum):
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    return randint (1,maximum)        
we need to define the maximum before we use it, but we need them to return a number between 1, and the maximum at the same time.

4) Print: Print is telling you to tell whatever is in the parenthesis to the player of the game.        return: After return you put a piece of code that is already defined; return is telling the program to return the thing right after to the player of the game        else: else is pretty much what it sounds like; it is the alternate option to whatever was before in the code.                if: if is telling you what to do if something happens.

1.        One time I got stuck was on the play function. To get past it, I wrote out what the play function should do multiple times in pseudocode. Then, my dad helped me translate it into python. Next, we tested it, changing a tiny bit until it worked.


2.        I think python is okay but I like scratch a lot more because there are cuter animals, and it is easier to tell a story with good animation. However, with lots of practice, I will be able to much more with python, which will make me like it more and more the more I do it.  


3.        Some code is indented in python after colons to show that a certain line occurs during a certain chain of actions. One time I used it:
if guess == (secretNumber):
        print ""Way to go! You won.""
        return True
    else:
        if guess > (secretNumber):
            print ""Too HIGH, guess again.""
        else:
            print ""Too LOW, guess again.""
        return False

     It means that if you won, it will say ""way to go...” and it will return true. But if you don’t win, it will tell you wether or not the guess is too high or low and return false.


4.        Python has many keywords. One is def, which means define. Def is used to define a new function which you will explain under on the next line. Second is while, which, in Scratch is repeat until. While is used to repeat the functions below until the variable = what you want it to be. Third is print, which basically shows the words in quotes on terminal. Fourth is not, which sometimes goes after while, as while not. In this context, it means you will repeat the function until the variable is NOT what you want it to be.

I had never really done computer programing before, and I thought it was really fun and interesting. I recognized this style of thinking from when I was trying to learn long division, and I kept getting it wrong. In the end I learned how to do long division, after finding out that I was doing something wrong. A time that I did that in Scratch, I was working on level 3, and the robot would not pick up the beacons. I stared at it for a while, then got up and took a break. The next day at school, I asked Chris what I was doing wrong, and he helped me get through it. I realized that my strategy did not work, and so I changed it by taking the problem apart and putting the pieces back together slowly. I used the strategies Take it Apart, Observe, Talk it Through, Take a Break, Break it Down, and Test Again and Again.","If I were to restart this project, I might make it simpler.

I tried to help it out, and ended up just saying, ""I will put this all in a nice, neat order, and hope that the sprite will get the point."" This didn't work at all, so I asked Chris for help the next day. He told me about a special little trick that helps the sprites know what to do and when. I used this, and it worked really well! I think that this technique will work many times in the future for me because I do things like assuming that a computer will just get what I want it to do a lot.","I used a technique that enabled my characters to sense what scene the story was on. Chris taught me that trick when I needed to figure out why my scene changer wasn't working, and I was completely confused.

Once, when I was playing Carol the Robot, I got stuck. She was always leaving one or two beacons. I scanned though the program for a while and noticed that the program should work based on what blocks I put down. Until I found out that in one of the boxes, when I meant to write “YES”, I accidently put two spaces in front of it. When I changed this, the program worked. I learned that sometimes it isn’t the blocks you put in the programs, but it can also be spelling errors. One of the problem-solving strategies that was on the board that helped me was to do a little at a time. I think this is important to do because if you write the whole program, then test it, and it doesn’t work, you won’t know where the problem is. I learned so much and had fun solving Carol the Robot puzzles.","I’m happy with how my project came out. If I had more time, I would have added credits at the end. I would have all of the characters coming out at the end. They would all bow. There could also be an interactive part in the credits.

I feel pretty confident about my experience with scratch because I have learned to program many things but I prefer Python over Scratch. The reason why I prefer Python over Scratch its because I get to play with the different techniques. In Scratch you just put blocks together to make the program work. 
Some code has to be indented in Python code because it means that the part that is the indented part is part of the certain code. For Example,
if guess == secretNumber:
        print(""Congrats!"")
        return True
    else, def, print, from:
else means, if there is a code that works and it also needs another part to it then you type in else and also type in the rest of the code to make the program work.
  else:
        if guess > (secretNumber):
            print(""Sorry, too high!"")

def means that you are defining the word or part of the program like 
def get_and_process_guess(secretNumber):
print means when you want to say something.
 print(""Sorry, too high!"")
from is when you want to add some coding like turtle.import you put from first then turtle.import.

What I mean is that if you look at the new one it let you have a key and go into the  cellar, but the old one just lets you click on what you want to see not play.","I was stuck when my project wouldn't let the back drop change because of one tiny typo like putting a space after the word, I was irritated but then when I realized the problem it was way easier",0,,0,2,3,"<p>This is my assessment of your Scratch Drawing project. (The assignment description is available on mrproctor.net.) Your work on this project Meets Expectations. Your project does what it is required to do, though you did not meet all the requirements for how the code is supposed to work.</p>
<p>The main Computational Thinking focus for this project was breaking large problems down into smaller problems by defining and reusing blocks--though this project was also an opportunity to practice your use of control structures such as loops and conditionals. Your use of these skills in this project Approaches Expectations. You created new blocks, but you did not reuse any blocks inside of other blocks. Just as you broke the main problem down into smaller problems, you can think of each block as a problem, and break it down into even smaller blocks.</p>
<p>If you are interested in resubmitting your project, please save a copy (so it has a new ID) and make any changes you would like to make. Then send me an email with subject line [7CS-RESUBMIT]. The email should contain a Scratch ID and a reflection responding to my feedback and telling me how you have changed your project. If you would like to meet with me to talk about your project and plan a resubmit, please let me know.</p>
<p>-Chris</p>","<p>The Guessing Game assignment was designed to help you learn Python--since I defined how the program should work, I am only assessing your ability to write syntactically correct Python, and your answers to the reflection questions. The Programming skills you demonstrated in this project Approaches Expectations. Your program passed all the tests in guess_test, but you did not submit the required reflection questions. (You can find these on mrproctor.net.) You didn't answer all the reflection questions.</p>",2,,2,"<p>In the Entrepreneurial Website assignment, you were asked to learn more HTML and CSS (and learn how to learn new techniques using online resources), use TextWrangler to edit files, and manage all the different files required to create a rich website. On this project, your use of these Programming skills Approaches Expectations. You successfully styled your page using a CSS stylesheet. Your menu includes links to the other pages. This makes it easier for users to get around your site. You turned in your webpage, but you did not send me the reflection questions. Please look these up on mrproctor.net and send these to me.</p>",,2,2,This is it.,TRUE,6.5,4,5,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,I decided paper because i can just write down my calculations.,"i used a calculator, it helped out a lot because I could just subtract the number and find if the difference on on the sheet.
